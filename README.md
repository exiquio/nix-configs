# nix-configs

This repo contains work-in-progress NixOS configurations.

- One is for daily personal use.
- The other is for offensive security testing.
  - This one is used within virt-manager (on a host running with the former config).

These are works in progress. They are updated constantly as I use my machines and/or learn more about NixOs.

Use them as examples to get you started. Note that you will want to change the hostnames and that there are
convenient Fish shell aliases for updating and upgrade (`update` and `upgrade` respectively).

Have fun. Nix is pretty cool, but it requires a paradigm shift for us old folks use to doing the *NIX the
old-fashioned way!
